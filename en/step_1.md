## Introduction

In this project, you'll create a pixel art editor. As well as using HTML and CSS you'll learn how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to your project.

## Introduction:
In this project, children create a pixel art editor. They will be introduced to JavaScript to change the colour of the pixels. They will also learn how to use HTML tables to create a grid of pixels.

## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Pixel Art' starting point](https://trinket.io/html/web-pixel)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Pixel Art' Finished](https://trinket.io/html/0e102a306b)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](../offline.html) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' folder, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This folder includes the following files:

+ template/index.html
+ template/script.js
+ template/style.css
+ pixel/index.html
+ pixel/style.css
+ pixel/script.js


You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ index.html
+ style.css
+ script.js

## Learning Objectives
+ Introduction to using JavaScript to create interactive web pages. 
+ Also introduces the use of table layout. 

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator).

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Resize your grid" - adding more rows and cells to a table;
+ "Make all pixels clickable" - add onclick code to all pixels.
+ "Add more colours to the palette" - add more colour to the palette and have them change the pen colour when clicked.
